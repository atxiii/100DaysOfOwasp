> What does ELF stand for (in respect to Linux?)
ELF is the first rock group that Ronnie James Dio performed with back in
the early 1970's.  In contrast, a.out is a misspelling of the French word
for the month of August.  What the two have in common is beyond me, but
Linux users seem to use the two words together.
