Jack-and-Jill Party:
	A Squire tradition; baby showers to which both men and
women friends are invited as opposed to only women.  Doubled
purchasing power of bisexual attendance brings gift values up to
Eisenhower-era standards.
		-- Douglas Coupland, "Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture"
