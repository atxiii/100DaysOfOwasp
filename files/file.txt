Clique Maintenance:
	The need of one generation to see the generation following it
as deficient so as to bolster its own collective ego: "Kids today do
nothing.  They're so apathetic.  We used to go out and protest.  All
they do is shop and complain."
		-- Douglas Coupland, "Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated
		   Culture"
